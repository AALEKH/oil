Building and Installing OSH
===========================

OSH is a bash-compatible shell, and is part of the Oil project
(http://www.oilshell.org).

This file describes how to install OSH.

Quick Start
-----------

To install as /usr/local/bin/osh:

    ./configure    
    make
    sudo ./install

To install as ~/bin/osh, which doesn't require root access:

    ./configure --prefix ~
    make
    ./install

NOTE: Out-of-tree builds are NOT currently supported, so you have to be in the
directory that contains ./configure and ./install.

System Requirements
-------------------

- libc, with development headers
- A C compiler
- bash (required for the build, may be relaxed later to POSIX sh)
- GNU Make

Optional:

- GNU readline library, for interactive features
  - https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives:

    sudo apt install build-essential

Alpine Linux:

    apk add libc-dev gcc bash make 


Build Options
-------------

./configure --help will show the options.  Right now, the only significant
options are --prefix and --{with,without}-readline.

Notes
-----

- The oil executable behaves like busybox.  If it's run directly, then argv[1]
  should be the name of a program:

    /usr/local/bin/oil osh -c 'echo hi'
 
  If it's invoked through a symlink like 'osh', then that is treated as the
  name of a program:

    /usr/local/bin/osh -c 'echo hi'

- OSH uses a slight fork of the Python 2.7 runtime.  It should therefore
  compile on with most compilers and operating systems.


TODO
----

- Add back PGO and LTO.  CPython has build support.
