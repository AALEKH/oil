OSH Quick Reference with Examples
=================================

This file gets converted to HTML and do a directory of .txt files for use in
OSH.

Meta-variables for
  foo        :  string
  out.txt    :  output file
  input.txt  : input file
  /some/dir/ : file system path
  $myvar     : var
  echo, ls   : a command

  echo foo >out.txt
  read myvar <input.txt

format of this file:

#BEGIN page
#END page

##### COMMAND LANGUAGE  (turns into <a name=>)
### Commands commands
# case
# if

# TOPIC true false   # link them together?



And there is stuff in the middle for HTML only?

# COMMAND LANGUAGE   (mark-down-ask)

## Commands

#BEGIN simple-command
Simple commands are separated by words:
    ls /

Redirects can also appear anywhere
    echo hi 1>&2

#END simple-command

#BEGIN semicolon ;
;  -- separate statements

#END semicolon ;


# BUILTINS

OSH aims to have almost all of the builtins that bash does.  Here they are,
divided into sections.

## I/O Builtins

These builtins take input and output.  They are often used with redirects[1].

[1] help redirects

#BEGIN read
Usage: read -p 
#END read

Or maybe get rid of #END -- it can just go until the next # command.  It's a
little bit like the spec tests honestly.  Can copy sh_specpy

#case

case: case WORD in [PATTERN [| PATTERN]...) COMMANDS ;;]... esac
    Execute commands based on pattern matching.

    Selectively execute COMMANDS based upon WORD matching PATTERN.  The
    `|' is used to separate multiple patterns.

    Exit Status:
    Returns the status of the last command executed.
 
Examples:

    case


#TOPIC getopt
use /usr/bin/getopt

#TOPIC kill
bash accepts job control syntax

#TOPIC enable
Bash has this, but OSH won't implement it.

#TOPIC osh-usage
Same as osh --help, man osh

#TOPIC oil-usage
Same as oil --help, man oil

#TOPIC external

External: bash has builtins that replace these external commands, but OSH
doesn't)
