Idea:

This is a short, dense, and slightly opinionated overview of OSH, a
bash-compatible shell.

(I don't want to write huge amounts of docs for OSH.  More for Oil.)

Maybe there will never be a proper manual?

- Flat namespace:  #let  #pipe  etc.
- SINGLE FILE.  Must be short enough for a single file.

- Turn the [osh-usage] into a man page.  Just refer to in-shell help and online
  manual in the man page.


I do like serif/san-serif for readaibilty

Syntax highlighting for code.  Do I need full markdown?

Bottom line:
- I'm saving writing the Online manual, in-shell help, and man page.  I'm
  writing a single text file that serves as all.

NOTE: Also do this for oil, wok, etc.

Other generated things:
  index of all #tags
  builtins in alphabetical order?

Idea: Examples from SPEC TESTS.  Hm.
  
You could have a file#label spec test or something.
