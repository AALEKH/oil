=========================

There are many components.

<div id="toc">
</div>

## The OSH Language is Compatible

TODO

## The Oil Language is New

TODO

## The Shell Runtime

TODO

### Builtins are the "Standard Library"

Both shell builtins and functions.

Oil has less of this.  The philosophy is to push more things outside, e.g. into
a "distro".

## The Interactive Shell, and "Headless Mode"

- Simple bash-like experience
- Defer most stuff to outside

## mycpp and "Tea": Speeding Up the Executable Spec

This is under the hood, but important to understand.

Making the project faster.

- Translator
- Small runtime with garbage collector

## Documentation (and the blog)

This is a big part of the project

Different kinds of docs:

- Preliminaries
  - This doc
  - Why Use Oil?
  - A Tour of the Oil Language
- Oil and OSH Help Topics (reference)
- Release Index: docs that are done
- Documentation Index
  - Command, Word, Expression, Runtime, Interchange Formats, etc.
  - Language design docs, dev docs
