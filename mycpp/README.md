mycpp
=====
 
This is an experimental Python-to-C++ translator based on MyPy.  It only
handles the small subset of Python that Oil uses.

It's inspired by both mypyc and Shed Skin.  

To run it, you'll need the MyPy source repository, as well as a virtualenv
containing MyPy's dependencies.

See the instructions at the top of `run.sh` for details.

TODO: Document this further.
