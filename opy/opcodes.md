Notes on VM Opcodes
===================

This is an elaboration on:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html

I copy the descriptions and add my notes, based on what I'm working on.


`SETUP_LOOP(delta)`

Pushes a block for a loop onto the block stack. The block spans from the
current instruction with a size of delta bytes.

NOTES: compiler2 generates an extra SETUP_LOOP, for generator expressions,
along with POP_BLOCK.


`POP_BLOCK()`

Removes one block from the block stack. Per frame, there is a stack of blocks,
denoting nested loops, try statements, and such.


`LOAD_CLOSURE(i)`

Pushes a reference to the cell contained in slot `i` of the cell and free
variable storage. The name of the variable is `co_cellvars[i]` if i is less
than the length of `co_cellvars`. Otherwise it is
`co_freevars[i - len(co_cellvars)]`.

NOTES: compiler2 generates an extra one of these


`MAKE_CLOSURE(argc)`

Creates a new function object, sets its `func_closure` slot, and pushes it on
the stack. `TOS` is the code associated with the function, `TOS1` the tuple
containing cells for the closureâ€™s free variables. The function also has `argc`
default parameters, which are found below the cells.


`LOAD_DEREF(i)`

Loads the cell contained in slot `i` of the cell and free variable storage.
Pushes a reference to the object the cell contains on the stack.


`GET_ITER()`

Implements TOS = iter(TOS).

NOTES: Hm how do I implement this?  It turns it from a collection into an
iterator.  Gah.

    PyObject *iter = PyObject_GetIter(iterable); 

    objects/abstract.c - 
    objects/iterobject.c - PySeqIter_New
    PySeqIter_Type has a it_seq field.  The PyObject being iterated over.  It
    maintains an index too.
    How does items() work as an iterable then?

    Then iter_iternext() calls:
    PySequence_GetItem(seq, it->it_index)



`LOAD_FAST(var_num)`

Pushes a reference to the local `co_varnames[var_num]` onto the stack.

NOTES:
This still does a named lookup?  Generator expressions do `LOAD_FAST 0 (.0)`
since there is no formal parameter name.

Oh I see, there is a `PyObject** fastlocals` in EvalFrame

It's initialized to `f->f_localsplus` -- frame holds them.  Oh I see, that's
where the frame setup is different!  Don't need inspect.callargs.


FastCall populates fastlocals from `PyObject** args` and `nargs`.
