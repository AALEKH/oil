    The proper usage sequence is:

    p = Parser(grammar, [converter])  # create instance
    p.setup([start])                  # prepare for parsing
    <for each input token>:
        if p.addtoken(...):           # parse a token; may raise ParseError

    A Parser instance may be reused by calling setup() repeatedly.

    A Parser instance contains state pertaining to the current token
    sequence, and should not be used concurrently by different threads
    to parse separate token sequences.

    See driver.py for how to get input tokens by tokenizing a file or
    string.

    Parsing is complete when addtoken() returns True; the root of the
    abstract syntax tree can then be retrieved from the rootnode
    instance variable.  When a syntax error occurs, addtoken() raises
    the ParseError exception.  There is no error recovery; the parser
    cannot be used after a syntax error was reported (but it can be
    reinitialized by calling setup()).

        The grammar argument is a grammar.Grammar instance; see the
        grammar module for more information.

        The parser is not ready yet for parsing; you must call the
        setup() method to get it started.

        The optional convert argument is a function mapping concrete
        syntax tree nodes to abstract syntax tree nodes.  If not
        given, no conversion is done and the syntax tree produced is
        the concrete syntax tree.  If given, it must be a function of
        two arguments, the first being the grammar (a grammar.Grammar
        instance), and the second being the concrete syntax tree node
        to be converted.  The syntax tree is converted from the bottom
        up.

        A concrete syntax tree node is a (type, value, context, nodes)
        tuple, where type is the node type (a token or symbol number),
        value is None for symbols and a string for tokens, context is
        None or an opaque value used for error reporting (typically a
        (lineno, offset) pair), and nodes is a list of children for
        symbols, and None for tokens.

        An abstract syntax tree node may be anything; this is entirely
        up to the converter function.
